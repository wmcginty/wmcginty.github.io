Hi! My name is Will

I have been making iOS apps now for over 10 years.

This site is mainly devoted to my personal hobby projects, like [Linked List](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linked-list/id1522236657). It is a tool born out of my own need for a more centralized method of testing universal links and AASA files across multiple domains. If you'd like to try it out before downloading, check out the [app clip](https://wmcginty.github.io/link).
